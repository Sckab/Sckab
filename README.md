Welcome to my digital crib! I’m a 16-year-old coding wizard-in-training from Italy, living life one freestyle at a time. 🎤✨

## About Me

- 🧠 Introvert with a creative spark — thinking deeply, spitting original vibes.  
- 💻 Passionate about programming: C, C#, C++, Python, and all the geeky stuff.  
- 🎮 Minecraft modder & community builder — I run **CreateMastery**, a Minecraft modding hub focused on the “Create” mod.  
- 🚀 Dreaming big: building cool projects like a custom OS called **SuperCool OS** and even cooking up a game with my squad **Parallex**.  
- 🤓 Always leveling up my skills and trying new tech challenges.  
- 😎 Lowkey funny and always ready to throw a silly joke your way.

## Skills & Tools

- Languages: C, C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- IDE: **Neovim** — my one and only editor, 'cause real pros don’t need fancy GUIs 😎  
- Game dev: Unity basics + modding Minecraft (Create mod gang!)  
- OS customization & hacking vibes 🔥

## What I’m working on

- Becoming an expert programmer, leveling up my skills every day  
- SuperCool OS: a custom operating system with Windows app support (because why not?)
